            <div>
                <img src="./assets/svg - Lionhound Designs LOGO SIMPLE ORIGINAL - CircleFrame.svg">
                <p>I am a humble student of visual arts, every single one that I can fit into my life. Lighting, pigment, proportion, frame rates, anchor points, contrast, color theory and anything in between are where my interests 
                    perpetually lie. Since I was young, I have been wrestling to put my imagination onto paper, screen, or any other medium I can harness to make the unrealized become real.<br/><br/>

                    At every point of my education, I have been torn between my fascination with the sciences and my love for art and design, and my aptitude tests will attest to this fact. My style always seems to be seeking out a balance between two virtually incompatible extremes. I might seek out mechanical impeccability paired with gentle gradients, or to fuse clean eastern sensibiiities of linework with warm, voluminous shapes of western tradition. Because of my love science and art, in seemingly incompatible interests, nothing looks quite so beautiful to me as perfectly proportioned humanity side by side with impeccably fashioned futurism, the human figure meeting technology.
